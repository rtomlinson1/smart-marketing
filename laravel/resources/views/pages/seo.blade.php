      <p>Can you find your website on Google? If not, then be certain that your customers can't either. SEO is a complex and ever changing art form. There is no published master-list of "How to rank #1 organically on Google". Anyone who tells you otherwise is not being completely honest with you. So if you are ready to invest in SEO, buckle up for a long and bumpy road.</p>
      <p>We can't promise that our SEO strategy will put you #1 in every search, but we can promise that, over time, our strategies will identify key word searches that you need to rank higher for, and slowly <span class="standout">help you rise</span> in those searches. To supplement SEO, we will recommend advertising campaigns to help you get found now, while you build your organic reach. If you stick with it, eventually your customers will find your business when searching your relevant key words and phrases. This will <span class="standout">save you a lot of money</span> in the long run, because ads are expensive, and getting found organically has no per-click cost.</p>
      <p>There are many factors that go into an SEO strategy. If you are ready to take that step, get in touch with us for a consultation to identify your needs and create a <span class="standout">custom strategy</span> for your business. It's important to note that all of our SEO tactics are "white-hat" meaning that we don't engage in any shady tricks to try and rank you higher, so there's no risk to getting penalized, banned or blacklisted.</p>
