      <h2>Branding with a mission.</h2>
      <p>Whether your local congregation is 20 or 20,000, modern church services have many technical needs. If your church is on the smaller side, you may not yet have staff or volunteers with the <span class="standout">experience to create graphics,</span> slides, posts, and maintain your web presence. Let us take that off your plate, so you can have that time and mental energy back to focus on other areas.</p>
      <p>Its tempting to think that branding is not important for a church. The ultimate goal is to reach people with the gospel right? The truth is, that people are still people no matter your industry or affiliation. People don't want to hear what you have to say if they can't <span class="standout">identify with you.</span> Put in other words, your influence is unlikely to extend past your reach. The good news is, reaching more people does require you to change or dilute your message. We want to help you evaluate the way people perceive your messaging, and determine the best way to put that messaging out through social media and other advertising methods. We aren't here to tell you what to say, just how to present your messaging and get it out effectively.</p>
      <p>Smart Marketing also helps many churches with their weekly needs. From sermon slides to audio/video editing and upload, our goal is to provide a wide range of specialized skills to help you accomplish your goals. We offer <span class="standout">special pricing</span> to churches and non-profits, so get in touch to work out a plan that is both helpful and affordable. </p>
